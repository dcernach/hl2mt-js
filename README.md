# hl2mt-js: Hero lab to MapTool

A small Node/Electron (former Atom Shell) app which allows you to create and edit MapTool tokens generated from Herolab/Pathfinder portifolios. It was mainly based on the works from Mark Mealman (https://bitbucket.org/mmealman/).

## About

``hl2mt-js`` parses output from Hero Lab and converts it into usable Maptool tokens that have basic die roll macros and text references. hl2mt is a Node/Electron application that has HTML5/CSS3 graphical interface that will run under Linux, Mac and Windows. The application will have a lot of configuration options that should allow anyone to customize the created tokens so they work with existing Maptool frameworks.

As a plus, it will offer you a better way to edit your existing tokens from any MapTool framework which is a better option than editing the token information in the *awful* MapTool Token UI.
